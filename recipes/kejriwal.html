<h2>What you'll need...</h2>

<h3> ...on hand</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Two fat slices of thick sourdough</li>
    <li>80g <em>hand grated</em>cheddar</li>
    <li>2 spring onions, chopped as you like</li>
    <li>1 green chilli (or 2, if you like it spicy), finely chopped</li>
    <li>A glob of olive oil</li>
    <li>2 large, <strong>free range</strong> eggs</li>
    <li>The black pepper they do in the coop with the grey lid</li>
    <li>As much polish ketchup as it is physically possible to muster</li>
</ul>

<h3>...to do</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Don't bother pre-heating the oven, itĺl be fine</li>
    <li>Don't toast the bread</li>
    <li>Squash the cheese and spring onions together in a bowl, making sure to really smush it up. Coat the bastards in pepper too, the more the merrier.</li>
    <li>Put aside some of the beautiful cheese mix; you're going to cook eggs in it</li>
    <li>Spread the mix over the bread. Use your hands and/or a spoon and make sure the bread is <strong> covered</strong></li>
    <li>Put the bread on a baking tray and whack it in the oven</li>
    <li>Eat some of the beautiful cheese mix. You should probably keep another portion to snack on.</li>
    <li>Fry the eggs in oil and the beautiful cheese mix </li>
    <li>Use your judgment to decide when the bread is toasted; I like to burn it slightly at the bottom, but itś really up to you.</li>
    <li>Whack the egg onto the bread, and serve after you've remembered to make the <a href="./beans.html"> Masala Beans</a> </li>
    <li>Add a huge thing of polish ketchup on the side</li>
</ol>
